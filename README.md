# JWKS (JSON Web Key Set) tester

A few scattered, rough, bodged together scripts for testing JWKS.
Eventually this could be turned into some sort of generalized JWKS tester.

## App Possibilities

- read in JWKs from either URL or JSON file upload
- validate the format of the file
- load in and validate each key
- verify a token using the JWK (url or JSON file)
